Hi, my name is Rafael Benevides. I am 38 years old Brazilian that actually lives in Raleigh,NC. Here, I work as Senior Software Engineer at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en).

I started learning Java in 2003 at a Lato Sensu Class. It was a first love sensation. After that I have been studying and trying to use Java as a Powered, Scalable and Productive Solution. As a result from this love I took certifications below:

- 2003 – Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform 1.4
- 2004 – Sun Certified Web Component Developer for J2EE 1.4
- 2006 – Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for Java Platform Enterprise Edition Technology
- 2007 – Sun Certified Business Component Developer for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5
- 2007 – ITIL Foundation Certified
- 2007 – SAP Netweaver Certified
- 2008 – Sun Certified Java Associate
- 2009 – IBM Certified Specialist: Software Quality
- 2010 – JBCAA – JBoss Certified Application Administrator – EAP 5
- 2012 – JBCD-Seam – JBoss Certified Developer in Seam
- 2012 – JBCAA – JBoss Certified Application Administrator – EAP 6

My contact with technology begun in 1988/1989 when I did my first IPD(Data Processing Introduction) and MS-DOS training. On that days, computers were like from another planet. They were very expensive. Each computer had a price of a popular car. I also made DBASE3 and Lotus 123 courses that year. So in 1994 my father and mother gave me an unforgettable birthday gift. It was a 486 Cytrix dx2 66Mhz with 8MB of ram and 100MB Hard Disk .

In 1995 a new ISP (Internet Service Provider) called [Genetic](http://www.genetic.com.br/) was founded in my town. They’re using Slackware Linux. That year I had my first contact with the Internet. When everyone was installing Win95, I was installing my Linux Slackware copy… The motivation was people saying: “Wow! Linux, that’s a Hacker SO!” (laughs). In 1996 a started at university and also started to work in [Genetic](http://www.genetic.com.br/). There I had a great teacher, [Flavio de Sousa](http://flaviodesousa.com/) who is an incomparable mind and an incomparable geek :)

From 2001 to 2004 I worked at [Lab. Neo Química](http://www.neoquimica.com.br/) as System Analyst (started as Support Analyst) and participated on Fox Project. An SAP R/3 installation project including modules: MM(Materials Management), FI(Financial), CO(Controlling), QM(Quality Management), PP(Production Planning), SD(Sales and Distribution) and WM(Warehouse Management). I was QM and PP Key-User.

After I finished my Lato Sensu graduation in 2004, I moved to Brasilia where I worked until may 2007 in Politec allocated in [Justice Ministry](http://www.justica.gov.br/) where I participated in many projects that uses Java from Persistence Engine, passing by Business Component, and finally in view (Web or Desktop).
I worked for [Summa Technologies](http://www.summa-tech.com/) and [INEP](http://www.inep.gov.br/) developing system with 20.000 simultaneous users.

In 2009 I joinned [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en) as JBoss Consultant and in 2012 I moved to Software Engineer working hard to promote enterprise Java solutions in an effective way.

My actual interests are:

- Object Oriented Architectures
- Productive and Scalable Java Solutions
- TI Methodologies / Agile Methodology
- DevOps tools and principles
- Javascript
That’s all.

Thank you for reading. And I hope to see you again.
